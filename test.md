The

Apple AirPods (2nd generation) Truly Wireless

are practically the same as the
Apple AirPods (1st generation) Truly Wireless
, with slight differences. They have a similar sound profile that lacks low bass, and their design is the same as the older model, but you can now purchase them with a case that supports wireless Qi charging, which is nice. Their one-size-fits-all design isn't ideal for everyone, but if you do manage a good fit, they're very comfortable. They're also open-back earbuds, meaning they won’t block out ambient noise but are suitable for outdoor sports like jogging because they allow you to hear your surroundings. However, some may find they don't have the most stable fit. Overall, the

AirPods 2

aren’t worth the upgrade if you already have the first model.
## Our Verdict
6.6
Neutral Sound
The Apple AirPods 2nd Gen are adequate for neutral sound. Instruments and vocals are present and detailed, but an overemphasized treble range makes them sound bright and harsh. The bass range, although punchy, lacks low-end thump and rumble. However, their sound delivery varies depending on how they fit you, meaning you may have a different experience. Like most in-ears, they have an awful soundstage. Also, unfortunately, they don't work with an app or software that gives you access to an EQ, so you can't fine-tune their sound if you don't like it out-of-the-box.
Pros

- Great build quality.
- Fairly well-balanced mid and treble ranges.
Cons

- Bass delivery varies significantly across users.
- No EQ or presets.

Commute/Travel
The Apple AirPods 2nd Gen are mediocre for commuting. Their open-back design means that they don’t block out much outside noise, and they don't isolate you from any low-frequency noises like engine rumbles, which isn't ideal for commuting. On the upside, they're very portable, light, and comfortable to wear if you can get a good fit. Their four-hour battery life is long enough for most commutes. You might have to take a break to charge them when on a long flight, but they only take 30 minutes to fully charge.
Pros

- Great build quality.
- Fast charging time.
- Unique and distinguishable design.
Cons

- Poor noise isolation.
- Limited control scheme.
- Bass delivery varies significantly across users.

Sports/Fitness
The Apple AirPods 2nd Gen are very good for sports. Their one-size-fits-all design is fairly comfortable, but it isn’t the most stable for everyone. How they fit greatly depends on the size and shape of your ear. Their open-back design is suitable for people who run or work out outside and want to be aware of their surroundings but won't help those who want to block out the noise of a crowded gym. Also, unfortunately, they don’t have a great control scheme, so it's not easy to adjust your playlist or volume when you're on the move.
Pros

- Great build quality.
- Fast charging time.
- Unique and distinguishable design.
- Very light and portable.
Cons

- Poor noise isolation.
- Limited control scheme.
- Bass delivery varies significantly across users.

Office
The Apple AirPods 2nd Gen are mediocre for office use. While they're very lightweight and quite comfortable for most, their open-back design means they don’t block any ambient chatter or other office-type noises and leak some audio at high volumes, which could bother your co-workers. Their roughly four-hour continuous battery life isn't enough to last through a 9-5 workday. That said, they recharge very quickly, so you can charge them fully during lunchtime and get another four hours for the second half of your day.
Pros

- Fast charging time.
Cons

- Poor noise isolation.
- Limited control scheme.
- Bass delivery varies significantly across users.

Wireless Gaming
The Apple AirPods 2nd Gen are Βluetooth-only headphones, so they aren't compatible with Xbox or PlayStation consoles. They're compatible with Bluetooth-enabled PCs, but their latency is likely too high to be suitable for gaming. Their latency with Android phones is also high. It's lower with iOS devices but may still be too high for mobile gaming.

Phone Calls
The Apple AirPods 2nd Gen are sub-par for phone calls when connected via PC. Their microphone recording quality can make voices sound thin and lacking in presence. However, their noise handling performance is alright. Your voice is separated from moderate ambient sound so that you're heard clearly. However, your voice can be drowned out by louder sounds. When connected via an iPhone, your voice sounds a bit clearer, but the mic offers a slightly worse noise handling performance.
Pros

- Fast charging time.
Cons

- Poor noise isolation.
- Limited control scheme.

## Differences Between Sizes And Variants
The

Apple AirPods 2nd generation

are available in one color variant: 'White'. They're sold with either the same case that came with the
Apple AirPods (1st generation) Truly Wireless
, which charges via Lightning cable or with one that supports Qi wireless charging. We tested the Qi wireless charging case variant, but we expect the other variant to perform similarly to our model. If you come across another variant or your headphones are different, please let us know in the discussions below so we can update our review.
## Compared To Other Headphones
Like the
Apple AirPods (1st generation) Truly Wireless
and the
Apple AirPods (3rd generation) Truly Wireless
, the

Apple AirPods 2nd Generation

stand out for their open-back design, which means they struggle to reproduce low-bass and don't really isolate you from ambient noise. Compared to the 3rd generation, they have shorter continuous battery life and lack some features, like virtual surround sound. Ηowever, depending on the shape of your ears, you may prefer the 2nd generation's slimmer earbud shape, which some find more comfortable. If you like their design but want headphones that block out ambient sound, closed-back models like the
Anker Soundcore Life P3 Truly Wireless
or earbuds with ANC like the
JBL Live Pro+ TWS True Wireless
have a similar look and better noise isolation.
We also suggest taking a look at our recommendations for the
best truly wireless earbuds
, the
best noise cancelling earbuds
, and the
best Bluetooth earbuds
.
Apple AirPods Pro Truly Wireless
Searching
Finding Store
The
Apple AirPods Pro Truly Wireless
are much better than the
Apple AirPods (2nd generation) Truly Wireless
. The Pro's sound profile is much more balanced, especially in the bass range, and their in-ear design and ANC provide significantly better noise isolation. The Pro also have an easier-to-use control scheme and feel much more stable in the ear. However, the non-intrusive fit of the

AirPods 2

may be more comfortable for some people, and they charge much quicker.

Apple AirPods (3rd generation) Truly Wireless
Searching
Finding Store
The
Apple AirPods (3rd generation) Truly Wireless
and the
Apple AirPods (2nd generation) Truly Wireless
have different strengths, so you may prefer either depending on what you're looking for. The 3rd generation have a longer continuous battery life and button-like controls that are easier to use than the 2nd generation's touch-sensitive surfaces. With iOS devices, they support Spatial Audio and head tracking for virtual surround sound, and their 'Adaptive EQ' adjusts the sound profile depending on how they fit you. Their bulkier design may put pressure on the inside of your ears, but both versions have a one-size-fits-all design, meaning you may prefer either, depending on the shape of your ears. On the other hand, the 2nd generation have a better overall mic performance.

The second generation model now uses the H1 chip, has better wireless range, and should have less latency, although we measured the opposite.

because of their closed-back design that isolates more ambient noise. This makes the Anker better suited for the office and commuting. However, the Apple are more comfortable and feel slightly better built than the Anker. The Apple are also more portable, thanks to their great case. If you use them with an iOS device that can take advantage of the H1 chip, we expect noticeably lower latency on the Apple. On the other hand, the Anker deliver sound more consistently and have noticeably more bass.

The
Apple AirPods (2nd generation) Truly Wireless
and the
Skullcandy Indy Truly Wireless
have different strengths. The Apple have a better build quality and recharge much more quickly. They also have a more neutral sound profile, which some may prefer, although it lacks low-bass. On the other hand, the Skullcandy have a dark, bass-heavy sound profile that EDM and hip-hop fans may like. They also leak less sound at high volumes and do a much better job blocking out noise like background conversations.

The

are better truly wireless headphones than the
Apple AirPods (2nd generation) Truly Wireless
. The Skullcandy don't feel as well-built as the Apple, which have a very premium, lightweight feel, and they don't connect to Apple devices as seamlessly. Their battery life is also worse as their case is rated for only two additional charges unlike Apple's five. On the upside, the Skullcandy's sound profile is more bass rich, which some may prefer, and they offer a much more comprehensive control scheme. Their in-ear fit also gives them a more consistent sound profile among various users.

The

are very differently-designed headphones, which you might prefer depending on your needs. The Apple are more conventional in-ears and leak much less audio. Their truly wireless design and compact charging case make them much more portable as well. On the other hand, the AfterShokz deliver sound via bone induction and sit outside your ears. Because of their design, they don't block any ambient noise, which is great for people who exercise outdoors. They also have an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance.

The
Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Truly Wireless
are more versatile truly wireless headphones than the
Apple AirPods (2nd generation) Truly Wireless
. The Cambridge closed-back design isolates against more ambient noise, making them a suitable option for commuting. It also means that they pack a bit more punch in the bass range than the Apple. On the other hand, the Apple are better built, and their one-size-fits-all design is very comfortable if you can find the right fit. The Apple have a shorter continuous battery life than the Melomania, but they charge more quickly and also have less latency when watching video content, especially if you can take advantage of the H1 chip. A certain variant of the Apple also supports wireless charging for the case, which the Cambridge can’t do.

They're very lightweight, though, and if you can achieve a nice fit in your ears, you can barely feel them. They also don’t enter your ear canal very deeply or create a plunger-like feeling, which some listeners may appreciate.

We have changed 'OS Compatibility' from 'iOS' to 'Not OS specific' as the call and music controls work on both Android and iOS devices. However, Android users can't use the voice assistant feature. As a result, we have updated our review to reflect this change.
The

Apple AirPods 2nd Gen

have a limited control scheme. If you're using an iOS device, you can use the built-in settings interface to set what happens when you double-tap each earbud: skip track backward or forward, play/pause (and answer an incoming call), or activate Siri. Your audio will also automatically pause when you take the earbuds out of your ears. You can disable ear detection and the touch-sensitive surface if you prefer. Unfortunately, there's no option to change the volume with the onboard controls, although you can enable 'Hey Siri' on your iOS device to control everything with your voice. If you're not using an Apple device, double-tapping either earbud skips to the next track, but you can't change this. If you're using a Windows device, you also can't accept calls from online services like Microsoft Teams. That said, you're able to play and pause media as well as skip tracks on Windows.

**Update 11/26/2021:**
After testing the
Apple AirPods (3rd generation) Truly Wireless
, we noticed that the scoring of the 2nd generation's case needed to be reevaluated. The case feels great, but there are similar cases that are as good, if not better than this one. While it's small, lightweight, and supports wireless charging, it doesn't support MagSafe charging, and the one indicator light doesn't do much to tell you the level of the case or buds. As a result, we have lowered the scoring of this test from 9.0 to 8.5.
The

Apple AirPods 2nd Gen

have an excellent case. With the same sleek design as its predecessor, it protects the headphones well against minor falls and scratches but not against water damage. The case is the same size as the one that came with the
Apple AirPods (1st generation) Truly Wireless
, but it supports Qi wireless charging. However, if you don't need this feature, you can also get them with the same case as the previous generation, which only charges via Lightning instead.

have okay stability. They have a one-size-fits-all design and don't come with different tip options, so your experience varies depending on the shape and size of your ears. If you plan to use these earbuds during a light activity like walking, they should stay put as long as you have a good fit. Their wireless design also means that you don't have to worry about snagging a cable on the kitchen corner and ripping the headphones from your ears. That said, take a look at the
JBL Tune 225TWS True Wireless

The

They do somewhat better in the treble range, which includes noises like the hum of an AC unit, but you still may not notice any difference. However, if you like to run or do other outdoor activities while listening to music, you may appreciate that these allow you to hear your surroundings. On the other hand, if you don't like the open-back design, the

**Update 11/26/2021:**
We have retested 'Recording Quality' and 'Noise Handling' to see if there's a difference in performance between Bluetooth AAC and SBC codecs. Our testing PC doesn't support AAC, which is the license-free standard for Apple devices. However, we conducted this microphone retest while the headphones were placed on our test head and connected to an iPhone 11, which supports AAC. To retest 'Recording Quality', we played the same 'Recorded Speech' audio clip through our test head. While Bluetooth codecs aren't the sole factor in microphone performance, using the AAC codec, the voice sounds clearer than when connected to our test PC and using SBC codec. You can hear our results
here
.
For 'Noise Handling', we played the 'Speech + Pink Noise' and 'Speech + Subway Noise' audio clips. Using the AAC codec, the mic offers a slightly worse performance
blocking out pink noise from speech
than when connected to our test PC. That said, the mic can
block out slightly more noise in the subway recording
when connected to an iPhone versus a PC. However, it also cuts out some speech in the process.
We have updated our review, but there hasn't been a change in the scoring of our microphone tests regarding AAC codec. To ensure comparability between different reviews, we test the mic of Bluetooth headphones using SBC codec as it's almost universally used by these devices.

However, we have dropped the score for 'Speech + Pink Noise' from 8.5 to 7.5 to better reflect the quality we heard during a call. We have updated our review to reflect these changes.
The microphone has alright noise handling capabilities. Your voice is brought in front of moderate noise, and you can easily hear what's being said. However, with loud sounds, your voice can be drowned out.
